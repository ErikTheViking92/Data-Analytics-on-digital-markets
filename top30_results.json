(For everyone who thinks Dragon Knight turning into a dragon is awesome but would be more awesome if he turned into Rathalos instead, great news: Capcom was just as excited as we were to make this happen). There are six Monster Hunter-themed item sets to collect in all, each bringing a classic Monster Hunter armor set into the Dota world, and each with three craftable alternate versions. There's also a new Palico courier with craftable costumes, and even your very own pet Poogie with craftable outfits. Your Poogie will hang out in your base, waiting to give you love whenever you return (and, assuming he is house trained, not pooping on your base).

Their first stumble came against Xtreme Gaming in a three-hour slugfest. Falcons ultimately fell, but their resilience was on full display. Next, they wiped away Team Liquid 2-0, but the following series against Tidebound was much more turbulent. Falcons lost, and suddenly elimination was looming. Their opponent in the elimination round? Team Spirit, the tournament favorites. The Result? A 2-0 statement from Falcons that sent the perennial powerhous...",

Wait, what? Bear with me.One of the main issues with Rust progression is that the majority of servers don’t Blueprint wipe, including our Facepunch servers. When you join a freshly map-wiped server but already have everything unlocked, you’re effectively skipping the entire early and mid-game. You craft late-tier items immediately, bypassing all the gear and choices before it, which completely breaks the sense of progression on a wipe. Given the current state of the game, we may as well unlock or remove BPs, which seems crazy. Today, we’re wiping all Blueprints, wiping all servers, and drastically reducing tech tree and research costs:Common: 15 (down from 20)Uncommon: 30 (down from 75)Rare: 60 (down from 125)Very Rare: 120 (down from 500)We’ve also removed...",

This was regarding all the \"Steam Error\" you saw.Now regarding the emojis:I saw a lot of posts and read a lot of comments regarding your concerns.

I will try to deploy that update today. We will introduce a exchange for emojis later (probably starting of next week) where you can trade up your emojis.A big sorry for the update and the mess i produced.Thank you again for voicing your concerns and feedback! It is super importan...",

With Valve notoriously hush about upcoming projects, virtually everything we've heard about 'HLX', as it's referenced, has come from datamines. But it's not the only mystery project that's been spotted this year, as a new branch for something titled 'TF' has emerged too, seemingly in reference to Team Fortress. Now, some new TF-related code has been highlighted by notable Valve sleuth Tyler McVicker, which he says is \"effectively direct confirmation\" that <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong> is being ported into Source 2. <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/source-2-port-datamine-valve\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/classic-mod-steam-beta-canceled-valve\">Valve red tape sees long-running Team Fortress 2 Classic mod scrap Steam beta</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/summer-update-2025\">Valve's new Team Fortress 2 update adds ten maps and a lethal taunt</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/system-requirements\">Team Fortress 2 system requirements</a> ",

Clipping Masks for Puppet Warp Animations Clipping masks are a useful tool to implement certain animations which were not easily possible previously. With clipping masks, you can define certain areas of a puppet model which only become visible when they are hovering over the area that you have defined. This can be used to implement some unique effects and is especially useful for creating the appearance of animated shadows or shading on an object. {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26312799/51142e2dd25a259174087a4d1f104009e64e6a1b.gifSelf-shadowing example achieved with a clipping mask To learn more about how to utilize clipping masks, take a look at our designer documentation.

Retiring Support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 Since Steam has officially dropped support for Windows 7 and Windows 8 in January 2024, we are now following suit for the same reason: third-party libraries that we require are not being updated for these older versions of Windows anymore. Maintaining ongoing support would prevent us from providing complete updates for Windows 10 and 11. If you are one of the 0.5% Steam users running Windows 7 or Windows 8, we have prepared a way for you to roll back to Wallpaper Engine 2.4.

Models can now also have a much more complex material setup similar to what can already be done in 2D wallpapers for puppets, including physical-based rendering \"PBR\" through various texture maps. In simple terms, you can now configure model materials to properly represent different substances like a shiny piece of metal or a piece of clothing. The model editor allows you to organize animations inside the model data and turn them into clips that you can use in your wallpaper.

We will walk you through some of the most impactful new features in this update. User Texture Imports Another highly requested feature was the ability to allow for users to import their own images and even videos into existing wallpapers created with the Wallpaper Engine editor. These altered versions of a wallpaper can then also be shared on the Steam Workshop as so-called wallpaper presets. We are sure this will lead to a whole new series of popular and highly customizable wallpapers, so be on the look out for new and updated wallpapers with this feature! {STEAM_CLAN_IMAGE}/26312799/633bc12477b29cc14c6f445874b670dbec528d38.gif Credits for the sample video files go to Aduare and illuskate.

On the banks of the Trondheimsfjord lies the charming city of Trondheim, with over a thousand years of history dating back to the Viking Age, when it was founded by Olav Tryggvason in 997.

In many ways, it's fitting: while the 12-minute war that Everett finds herself embroiled in certainly is hellish, the quest's adjacent plotline, The Devil's Triad, adds the new 'devilframe' Uriel and Descendia mode, both of which are inspired by classical depictions of Dante's Inferno and other religious iconography. \"It's not a coincidence that there's a devil Frame, and that an Orokin has an unfortunate relationship with that devil Frame,\" Ford says with a smile. \"None of this is an accident.\" <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/the-old-peace-release-date\">Read the rest of the story...</a> RELATED LINKS: <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/new-content-skip-the-old-war-interview\">Warframe's The Old Peace skip is \"sh*tty\" for some, but it's Digital Extremes' \"survival strategy\" in a busy crowd</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/codes\">Warframe codes November 2025 and how to redeem</a> <a href=\"https://www.pcgamesn.com/warframe/devstream-the-old-peace-devils-triad-romance\">Warframe The Old Pe...</a>",

With only one player leading the line, you need to think carefully about how the surrounding roles combine to create chances. You can’t just set your striker as a Poacher and expect them to score consistently. Your striker’s Attributes and Traits work together to make a significant impact on their performance. To read the full story and more, visit The Dugout. ",

Especially when you’ve got a parasite in your brain. </ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/27fb72f06f33541abbb74ab612f3baf9.webp?t=1759825106\" width=616 height=27 /></span><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">7 unique Origin heroes offer a hand-crafted experience, each with their own unique traits, agenda, and outlook on the world. Their stories intersect with the overarching narrative, and your choices will determine whether those stories end in redemption, salvation, domination, or one of many other outcomes. Play as an Origin and enjoy their stories, or recruit them to fight alongside you. </ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/de1c3f817c6e0604f5b039f2e7a95199.webp?t=1759825106\" width=616 height=27 /></span> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">based on the D&amp;D 5e ruleset. Team-based initiative, advantage and disadvantage, and roll modifiers join an advanced AI, expanded environmental interactions, and a new fluidity in combat that rewards strategy and foresight. Three difficulty settings allow you to customise the challenge of combat. Enable weighted dice to help sway the battle, or play on Tactician mode for a hardcore experience.  </ul><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/57e01cf6fdb5b3566a8e0e59efeb97cf.webp?t=1759825106\" width=616 height=27 /></span> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">featuring 31 subraces on top of the 11 races (Human, Githyanki, Half-Orc, Dwarf, Elf, Drow, Tiefling, Halfling, Half Elf, Gnome, Dragonborn), with 46 subclasses branching out of the 12 classes.

Our unique Character Creator features unprecedented depth of character, with reactivity that ensures whomever you are, you will leave a unique legacy behind you, all the way up to Level 12.

What becomes of them is up to you, as you enter real, vibrant relationships with those you meet along the way. Each companion has their own moral compass and will react to the choices you make throughout your journey. At what cost will you stick to your ideals? Will you allow love to shape your actions? The relationships made on the road to Baldur’s Gate act as moments of respite at camp as much as they add weight to the many decisions you make on your adventure. </ul> <br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1086940/extras/ef367cd782917646433ea156bf65754a.webp?t=1759825106\" width=616 height=27 /></span> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\">so that when you hit ‘go live’, your stream isn’t interrupted by a bear, swear, or lack of underwear.
